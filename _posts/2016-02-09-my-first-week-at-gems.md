Asena, our lead coordinator for this week’s program, asked the girls a question about DNA. Thinking back to fourth grade, I honestly don’t think I would have known what a cell was, let alone DNA. I vaguely remember learning about the inside of a flower. Science, at the time, didn’t seem exciting—it wasn’t “my thing.” But, to the girls at Hartshorn GEMS, science is always exciting. When Asena asked “What is DNA?” a few hands went up, a couple people knew. But what made me happiest was that one girl was so excited to raise her hand and answer the question that she couldn’t sit still in her seat. Whether they knew about DNA or not, this moment, for me, symbolized the attitude of all of these girls towards science—always excited and always ready to learn. 

This week was Session 2 of our Spring program, where we learned about cell biology and built play-doh models of an animal cell. Asena and the other presenters began by discussing the cell in a wider context. A cell is a tiny building block that makes up all life. Groups of cells make up tissues; different types of tissues make up organs; and a collection of organs make an organ system, several of which make up the human body. Then, we went back to a single cell, and this time even smaller—to the microscopic level. The girls learned about all the components of a single animal cell: the organelles, the cytoplasm, the cell membrane. 

The girls then made their own beautiful play-doh models of an animal cell, complete with ribosomes, a smooth and rough ER, a nucleus, nucleolus, and other organelles. Success! Everyone helped clean up and everyone got to take their own model of an animal cell home, culminating yet another successful week of Hartshorn GEMS. 

And it’s watching the girls have fun, learn, share, be enthusiastic and creative, that makes it all worth it.

There is so much more to learn! To review and learn more about all the intracellular organelles and their functions, here are some websites and online resources to take a look at.
