Our first ever, Fall 2015 Session of Hartshorn GEMS has begun! We'd like to thank everyone for the overwhelming support and for helping make this program possible. Here are the Fall 2015 dates:

- October 1, 8, 15, 22, 29
- November 12, 19
- December 3

Today at our first meeting, we drew and discussed what a "scientist" looks like to us. We then had fun with a project to build the tallest structure we can with only spaghetti, toothpicks, Dots, and marshmallows - together, we reached 167 cm!

At the end of class, we learned about GEMS and the different fields of STEM.

Next week, we'll delve into the world of biology!
