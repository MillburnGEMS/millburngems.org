<p>Want to discover a new planet? Develop the cure for an infectious disease? Invent a new mode of transportation? Create an app that changes millions of lives around the world?</p>

<p>Hartshorn GEMS is an after-school club for girls in grades 3-5 who are fascinated by STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) or would simply love to discover their interests. Led by <a href="/our-mission">students from Millburn High School</a>, it will feature investigative, hands-on projects introducing students to concepts in biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, math, and computer science. Meetings will be held <b>weekly on Thursdays from 3 to 4 pm</b> at Hartshorn, running parallel to the ASE schedule.</p>

<p>Why Hartshorn GEMS? Growing up, many girls are both very talented and fascinated by STEM subjects. But as they come to realize, it can be a bit intimidating to join an engineering or robotics class when there arenâ€™t many other girls there.</p>
